For hard-core programming types, here is the detail on the
DOS function. You will need to read up on invoking DOS interrupts
from your application.

Interrupt 15h  [Cassette I/O]
(0:0054h)       Renamed "System Services" on PS/2 line

(Note from Bill Kuhns: I skipped Functions 00h through 83h )

Function 84h    Read Joystick Input Settings                 (AT, XT/286, PS/2)
entry   AH      84h
        DX      00h     to read the current switch settings  (return in AL)
                01h     to read the resistive inputs
return  AX      A(X) value
        BX      A(Y) value
        CX      B(X) value
        DX      B(Y) value
        AL      switch settings (bits 7-4)
