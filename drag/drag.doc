   This program suite is designed for analysis and
optimization of the 'wind schedules' for the spring powered
race car to be entered in the 1991 'Great American Drag
Race'. 

   The car is powered by winding a cord around a spindle on
the drive axle. The spindle has 16 different diameters,
allowing control of the torque applied to the drive wheels.
In general, the cord is wound on successively smaller
diameters as the wind progresses, compensating for the
increased force as the springs are stretched out.

   The car is configured with 4 springs. Each spring
requires 8.6 pounds to begin stretching, and has a spring
constant of 3.065 pounds per inch thereafter. Useable spring
extension is 9 inches.

   The problem is to determine how many revolutions of cord
to wind on each spindle diameter in order to deliver the
optimum power to the drive wheels throughout the run. The
sequence of turns per diameter is called a 'wind schedule'.

   Once the actual runs have been plotted, they can be
analyzed to determine effective coefficients of friction
(CF). For the purposes of this model, CF is defined as
maximum possible acceleration force divided by total vehicle
weight.

   The optimizing portion of the program reads CF
profiles from a file named GOALS.DAT. It will then generate
a series of optimum wind schedules and analysis.

   The file FORM.TXT contains the log form used to record
actual run data. Information on various vehicle
configurations is recorded at the bottom of the form.
Information includes number of springs, axle station, weight
location, and axle offset.

                   MODELING AND ANALYSIS

   In order to acheive the fastest possible time, the torque
delivered to the drive wheels must be just short of the
amount necessary to break traction at all times, and the
entire weight of the vehicle must be on the drive wheels.

   In order to achieve this, two adjustments are necessary:
vehicle center of gravity and applied torque. In addition,
drivetrain effeciency and the effective coefficient of
friction between the drive wheels and the track surface must
be known.

   Knowing the spring constants, vehicle weight, and
drivetrain ratios, it is easy to calculate the maximum
possible acceleration. This model assumes that actual
acceleration is degraded by drivetrain loss and limited by
coefficient of friction, and attempts to infer values for
these parameters.

   This model makes some broad assumptions:

     o	Drivetrain efficiency is constant.
     o	Aerodynamic effects are negligible.
     o	Wheelspin is insignificant

   The first parameter that must be determined is drivetrain
efficiency. Make several runs with a somewhat conservative
wind schedule (to ensure no wheelspin). Use the program,
adjusting the efficiency value until the actual and
theoretical accelerations match for the run segments with
the highest actual acceleration values. Use the resultant
efficiency value for all subsequent analysis.

   The next step is to derive effective CF values. CF is
affected by vehicle CG, dynamic weight transfer, and
vibration, in addition to the physical limits of the tire
and track materials.

   Progress gradually to more aggressive wind schedules. At
some point, actual acceleration values for some segments
will start to fall below the calculated values. This
indicates that the CF value for that segment has been
exceeded.

   The torque profile is in inch-ounces of actual torque at
the drive wheels. Each print column represents 2" of ground
travel. The horizontal scale is in feet, with 21 feet at the
right edge.

   In optimization mode, the data at the top represents the
input data. There are two 'Extension' values: the first is
the maximum allowable extension, and the second is the
optimum extension for the calculated wind sequence. 

   The graph will be as for the 'analysis' mode, but the
desired torque profile will be shown as '+' characters.

   There is a strip chart at the bottom of the graph, which
can be used to wind the car. The strip chart is cut from the
graph and attached to the car, with the ^ symbol at the zero
point of the springs. Each successive mark shows the
extension at which the wind changes to the next smaller
diameter. The 'A' mark shows the final extension on the last
diameter (if the last diameter is used). 


THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS:

   The program will calculate the theoretical elapsed time
and velocity of the car at the 1.25, 5, 11.25, and 20 foot points.
This data is obtained by determining the force applied to
the car during each 2" interval and calculating the
resultant time required and incremental change in velocity
for that distance. The 2" increments are summed and printed
at each interval.

   The input file contains coefficient of friction values
for 2" increments of travel (multiplied by 50). These values
are plotted as '+' symbols.

   These values are combined with vehicle mass, drivetrain
efficiency, and tire diameter data to obtain the theoretical
torque required to break traction. A wind schedule is then
generated to provide this torque profile.

   Torques resulting from this wind schedule are multiplied
by drivetrain efficiency, and limited by the value of CF. 
Resulting effective drive wheel torques are printed as '*'
symbols.
